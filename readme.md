# Calamari Protocol (CP)

**AI agents negotiate meeting times—humans just show up.**

Calamari Protocol is an open, privacy-first standard that lets autonomous
calendar agents discover availability, propose “golden slots,” hold them with a
signed token, and commit the final event—all via JSON-RPC over HTTPS.  No
booking grid, no context-switch, no endless back-and-forth.

## Why CP?

* **Agent-first** – built for AI-to-AI negotiation.  
* **Interoperable** – speaks the same dialect across Google, Microsoft, Apple,
  and self-hosted stacks.  
* **Privacy-safe** – only salted busy-hashes leave the calendar boundary.  
* **Time-centric KPI** – optimises *hours protected* vs. meetings booked.
